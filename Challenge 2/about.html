          We are a collective <br />
          coming together to <br />
          destigmatize mental <br />
          health issues.

          When we lose hope, we fill the void with depression When we lose hope. we give up on life. But as much as we
          all need hope. What if we could all provide hope. too? What if by providing hope, we were giving ourselves
          hope in the process? What if was seen as a commodity for us all to trade freely? What if we were all brokers,
          and agent of hope? What if we could all self-deputize to make sure our family, friends, and colleagues, were
          all safe from harm?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, we can. All we need the ability to listen to another person. Because when we actually "hear" someone. We
          can help them "see" differently. We can create a connection that can help others reconnect with themselves. We
          can help them step out fo the mental illness closet, one word at a time. We can help them feel part of a
          community again. A community of survivors-now-counselors filled with hope. All sharing their stories to help
          others and create a cycle of hope
